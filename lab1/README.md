# Noir Lab Environment

Welcome to the **Noir Lab**! This repository provides a fully pre-configured development environment for students to complete their lab using [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/), a domain-specific language for writing zero-knowledge proofs.

## üöÄ Quick Start (with GitHub Codespaces)

This repo is designed for **zero local setup**. You can do everything from your browser using GitHub Codespaces.

### Steps:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Click the **`<> Code`** button on your fork, then click **`Codespaces` ‚Üí `Create codespace on main`**.
3. Wait for the Codespace to initialize (this takes a minute or two).
4. Open the built-in terminal and you're ready to go!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you are working inside your **own fork**. Do not push to this base repository.

## üß© What's Pre-Installed

Inside this Codespace environment, the following tools are pre-configured:

- [Noir Language](https://noir-lang.org/)
- [nargo](https://noir-lang.org/docs/nargo/overview/) (Noir‚Äôs package manager and CLI)
- Barretenberg backend (via `bbup`) for proof generation and verification
- Common utilities (git, bash, etc.)

No need to install anything ‚Äî just start coding.

### Noir Backends

Noir supports **multiple proving backends** ‚Äî different cryptographic engines that generate and verify proofs. Some backends are optimized for speed, some for compatibility with smart contracts, and others for minimal proof sizes.

In this lab, we are using the **Barretenberg backend**, installed via `bbup`. Barretenberg is a widely-used and efficient backend maintained by Aztec. It supports proof generation and verification for Noir circuits and integrates smoothly with `nargo`.

## üìù Lab Instructions

For this lab, we will be working with the **hello_world** example Noir project.

### About Noir and `nargo`

Noir is a language designed for writing **zero-knowledge circuits**. These circuits allow you to prove that you know something without revealing it. 

`nargo` is the CLI tool for managing Noir projects, compiling circuits, and preparing inputs for proving systems.

### Initializing the Project

Create the project using the following command:

```bash
nargo new hello_world
```

This creates two key files:

- `src/main.nr`: A boilerplate circuit.
- `Nargo.toml`: Project metadata (name, author, dependencies, etc.).

### Understanding `main.nr`

In `main.nr`, inputs are **private by default** but can be marked as **public** using the `pub` keyword. Here's an example circuit that proves you know a value `x` that is **not equal** to `y`, without revealing `x`:

```rust
fn main(x: Field, y: pub Field) {
    assert(x != y);
}
```

> Learn more about public/private inputs in the [Noir Data Types documentation](https://noir-lang.org/docs/types/overview/).

### Compiling and Executing

1. Change into your new project directory:
```bash
cd hello_world
```

2. Run `nargo check` to compile the circuit and create a `Prover.toml` for specifying inputs:
```bash
nargo check
```

3. Edit `Prover.toml` with valid inputs:
```toml
x = "1"
y = "2"
```

4. Execute the circuit:
```bash
nargo execute
```

This command will:
- Compile your circuit (if needed), outputting `./target/hello_world.json`
- Generate a **witness** based on your inputs, saved to `./target/hello_world.gz`

With both the compiled circuit and witness, you‚Äôre now ready to generate a zero-knowledge proof.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Using the Barretenberg CLI (`bb`)

Different proving backends may offer different tools and commands. For Barretenberg, the CLI tool `bb` is used to generate and verify proofs.

### üß™ Verifying Backend Setup

You can confirm that Barretenberg is properly installed by running:

```bash
bb --version
```

This ensures the backend is ready for use with `nargo`.

---

### Generate a Proof
After compiling your Noir circuit, run:

```bash
bb prove --scheme ultra_honk --oracle_hash keccak -b ./target/hello_world.json -w ./target/hello_world.gz -o ./target
```

> üí° **Tip:** File naming can be confusing when working with compiled circuits and witnesses. If you're unsure whether files are up-to-date, delete the `target` folder and recompile to avoid version mismatches.

### Verify the Proof

The proof is now generated in the target folder. To verify it we first need to compute the verification key from the compiled circuit, and use it to verify.

## üîë What is a Verification Key?

When generating zero-knowledge proofs, two key artifacts are produced:

- **Proving Key**: This key is used by the prover to generate a proof for a specific computation. It contains information about the circuit's structure and is essential for creating a valid proof that can be verified.

- **Verifying Key**: This key is used by the verifier to check the validity of the proof. It ensures that the proof corresponds to the specific circuit and public inputs. The verifying key allows the verifier to efficiently verify the proof without needing to know the entire circuit structure.


The **verification key ties the proof to a specific circuit**. It ensures that a proof was generated using the correct circuit logic and can‚Äôt be reused or forged for different computations. It is public and can be used by verifiers (e.g., graders or smart contracts) to confirm that the prover executed the correct circuit on valid inputs, without revealing those inputs.

---

To generate a verification key:

```bash
bb write_vk --scheme ultra_honk  --oracle_hash keccak -b ./target/hello_world.json -o ./target
```

To verify the proof/witness and make sure it is consistent with the verification key we run :

```bash
bb verify --scheme ultra_honk --oracle_hash keccak -k ./target/vk -p ./target/proof
```
---
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Verifiers know nothing about the private inputs ‚Äî they only use the compiled circuit (via the verification key) and the proof. This ensures private inputs remain confidential.

## üåê Deploying to Solidity on Sepolia via Remix

Noir circuits can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain using a verifier smart contract generated by Barretenberg. In this lab, we will deploy the `hello_world` verifier to the Sepolia testnet using Remix IDE. (We‚Äôve already covered how to use Remix and connect it to Sepolia via MetaMask, so we won‚Äôt repeat those steps here.)

### 1. Generate a Solidity Verifier Contract

```bash
bb write_solidity_verifier --scheme ultra_honk -k ./target/vk -o ./target/Verifier.sol
```

You will now find a `Verifier.sol` contract in your `./target` directory.

### 2. Compile in Remix

- Open Remix and create a new workspace.
- Copy and paste the contents of `Verifier.sol` into a new file.
- Enable optimization in the **Advanced Compiler Settings** (2000 runs is fine).
- Compile the contract. You may see warnings about contract size or stack depth ‚Äî these can be ignored for our purposes.

### 3. Deploy to Sepolia

- Select the `HonkVerifier` contract in the Deploy tab.
- Connect to Sepolia via MetaMask.
- Deploy the contract to the network.

### 4. Verify Proof On-Chain
To help you generate the inputs to Remix:

#### Extract the Public Input from the Proof

``` bash
echo "[\"0x$(od -An -v -t x1 ./target/proof | tr -d ' \n' | sed 's/^.\{8\}//' | cut -c1-64)\"]"
```
This command does the following:

- Runs `od -An -v -t x1 ./target/proof` to dump the file as hex.
- Pipes the output to `tr -d ' \n'` to remove spaces and newlines.
- Pipes that into `sed 's/^.\{8\}//'` to remove the first 8 hex characters (metadata about the proof size).
- Pipes that into `cut -c1-64` that takes the first public parameter made of 32 bytes
- Embeds the result into a string prefixed with `"0x` and wrapped in quotes and brackets via `echo`

#### Extract the Proof for Remix

```bash
echo "\"0x$(od -An -v -t x1 ./target/proof | tr -d ' \n' | sed 's/^.\{72\}//')\""

```

This command does the following:

- Runs `od -An -v -t x1 ./target/proof` to dump the file as hex.
- Pipes the output to `tr -d ' \n'` to remove spaces and newlines.
- Pipes that into `sed 's/^.\{72\}//'` to remove the first 72 characters (proof size the first 4 bytes + public input of size 32 bytes).
- Embeds the result into a string prefixed with `"0x` and wrapped in quotes via `echo`


#### Verify Function Success and Remix Behavior

The `verify` function in your contract is designed to **succeed silently** if the proof is valid‚Äîit simply completes execution without reverting, and it does not return any data. This means that a successful verification is indicated by the absence of a revert rather than by an explicit return value.

In Remix, however, this design can lead to some confusion. Since Remix's ABI decoder expects a return value from a function call, it may interpret the absence of output as an "out-of-gas" error. This is not actually due to insufficient gas, but rather because Remix is trying to decode a return value that doesn't exist. 

When testing your `verify` function in Remix, focus on whether the transaction completes without reverting rather than on the output. A non-reverting call is your signal that the proof verification was successful.
